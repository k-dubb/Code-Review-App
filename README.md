**< Code Review >** is a flashcard app for web developers. Anyone can come to the site and use the universal flashcards. Or, you can login and create your own flashcards if there's a topic not listed you'd like to create.

##Technologies used:##

MongoDB, ExpressJS, Angularjs, Node.js, Passport user auth, HTML, CSS, Semantic UI, Heroku

##Approach taken:##

I started with user stories to determine what I wanted users to be able to do. I then ranked the user stories into MVP, On Deck, and Ice Box using Trello. Next, I drew out wireframes for my pages using gliffy.com.

Drawing out the ERD was my next step. This helped me see the relationships between my data and assisted when I created the schema after setting up my NoSQL database in MongoLab.

I used the AngularJS framework for more real-time response when 'flipping' the flashcard and creating your own cards.

##Unsolved problems:##

With only a few days to build the app and having to do a lot of research on Angular since I had never used it before, I haven't completed the database relationship between a user being able to create their own flashcards (and store them), edit, or delete them. This app is a work in progress and I do plan on adding these features in the future.
